                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a young and enthusiastic learner, excited to explore the world of web development.
                    I enjoy creating new things and I'm always trying to improve my skills.
                    I'm passionate about making websites that are both fun and useful.
                    I enjoy creating websites. And completing a project is the best feeling. 
                    I wanted to create some other projects; I have the idea but the projects that I want to build required backend, which I don't know.
                    So, I want to learn backend and improve my frontend skills.

                <h2>Why Did I Build This?</h2>
                <p>
                    Qustezle is more than just a set of mini games; it is my playground for learning and experimenting with web development. 
                    Not only Qustezle mini games website, every website is a playground for me for learning and experimenting with web development.
                    And, my every single project has value to me, not only Qustezle mini games website.
                    I wanted to create something that would be fun for visitors, attractive and help me grow as a developer. 
                    I also wanted to create something that would be very userful or helpful for the users, but my ideas require backend skills, that why I can't create those project. 
                    I've implemented my ideas and features throughout the site. The user's feedback is crucial and will help me continuously improve and learn. 
                    Moreover, I really enjoy creating these types of websites.
                </p>
